##Skills
###Primary
NodeJS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Java, Lua
###Secondary
SQL, Processing, C++, C
##Workflow
For editing, I use SublimeText2. It has a clean interface, powerful multiline editing capabilities, and a package manager for its large amount of user plugins. If I am working on a NodeJs application, I use the package nodemon, a small application that monitors your files for change and restarts your Node application. Lastly, if I'm working on a web project, I use Google Chrome with Tincr, a plugin that allows you to save changes made in the developer tools as well as live updating the browser when a file changes.
##Projects
###[Kyoshi](https://github.com/BigIroh/Kyoshi)
Kyoshi is an abstraction on Socket.io that allows you to call server side Node as async functions from the browser. Its primary goal was to bring the client and server together while keeping a clean separation. This project was my answer to JooDee, an earlier project described below. 
###[JooDee](https://github.com/BigIroh/JooDee)
JooDee was supposed to be an answer to ASP and ColdFusion. A coworker and I were unhappy working with them and thought using JavaScript and Node would make it better. This was a good project to teach me the ins and outs of Node and JS but was flawed in design as it attempted to build linear pages with asynchronus code.
##Work Experience
###Web Developer - Hurd I/T and Communication (2012 - Present)
At Hurd, I wrote projects in ASP, ColdFusion, and JavaScript. I helped maintain, repair, and develop web applications as well as worked with clients to better design their websites and applications. I was involved in working on an internal site for Hurd that managed all of our sales, timetracking, server uptime, and more. For this I used ASP and jQuery. This was my main introduction to JavaScript as well as my inspiration to create JooDee.
###Software Developer - Intelitrac, Inc (2011 - 2012)
While working for Intelitrac, I worked on a large web application for asset tracking. Our stack consisted of Java, Java Server Faces, GlassFish, Hibernate, and Microsoft SQL Server. My particular job involved integrating external xml services like Expedia and Hotwire into a module, for the previously mentioned web application, that handled corporate travel. While there, I also helped in a complete refactoring of the backend of the application. This involved redesigning the database and helping to come up with a more logical server design that allowed for maximum code reuse.
##Education
I go to George Mason University and major in computer science. My expected graduation date is May 2014.
