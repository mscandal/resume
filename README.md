## Projects and Work Experience
### CTO & Co-Founder - Bloompop
March 2013 - Present

As CTO & Co-Founder, I had many duties: building and maintaining [Bloompop.com](https://www.bloompop.com), participating in the interview process for every candidate, participating in successfully pitching venture capital firms with my co-founder, building and maintaining [Freshcut Market](https://www.freshcutmarket.com), and building [My Fake Valentine](http://www.myfakevalentine.com).

#### Technologies:
Node.JS, Babel (ES 6/7/2015), Koa, Express, React, Mocha, Angular, Browserify, AWS (DynamoDB, S3, CloudSearch), CouchDB on Cloudant, LevelDB, Gulp, Angular, Jade, Stylus, Sass, Joyent, Heroku, Mandrill APIs, Hipchat APIs, Slack APIs, Quickbooks APIs, git, Trello, GitHub, Facebook APIs, Twitter APIs


## [co-stream-iterator](https://github.com/mscandal/co-stream-iterator)
An abstraction for making stream processing much flatter and easier to read in co and koa. This is used in [Freshcut Market](https://www.freshcutmarket.com). I have plans to release a version that returns a generator for use in `for...of` statements with no co or koa dependency.


## [koa-refresh](https://github.com/Bloompop/koa-refresh)
Unfinished library for live reloading stateless backend modules used in a koa server. It's used in [Freshcut Market](https://www.freshcutmarket.com) for local development and on the production site for quick deploys. I have plans to make a generalized and unopinionated version.


### [Kyoshi](https://github.com/BigIroh/Kyoshi)
Kyoshi is an abstraction on Socket.io that allows you to call server side Node as async functions from the browser. Its primary goal was to bring the client and server together while keeping a clean separation. This project was my answer to JooDee, an earlier project described below.


### [JooDee](https://github.com/BigIroh/JooDee)
JooDee was supposed to be an answer to ASP and ColdFusion. A coworker and I were unhappy working with them and thought using JavaScript and Node would make it better. This was a good project to teach me the ins and outs of Node and JavaScript but was flawed in design as it attempted to build linear pages with asynchronous code and failed at clean separation of form and function.


### Web Developer - Hurd I/T and Communication
October 2012 - March 2013

Helped maintain, repair, and develop web applications as well as worked with clients to better design their websites and applications. Worked on an internal site for managing all sales, time tracking, server uptime, and more.

#### Technologies:
ASP, ASP.NET, JavaScript, jQuery, ColdFusion, MySQL


### Software Developer - Intelitrac, Inc
June 2011 - September 2012

Worked on a large web application for asset tracking. Developed an upgrade involving integrating external xml services like Expedia and Hotwire for purchasing and organizing flights, hotels, and rental cars. Assisted in a complete refactoring of the backend of the application. This involved redesigning data schemas and helping to come up with a more logical server design that allowed for maximum code reuse.

#### Technologies:
Java, Java Server Faces (JSF), Primefaces, Microsoft SQL, GlassFish, Hibernate
